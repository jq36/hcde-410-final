## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and normalize data for better model performance.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and interpret the distribution of app attributes and their relationship with user ratings.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that improve the predictive power of the model.  
4. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate machine learning models, including regression and classification approaches.  
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), accuracy, and feature importance to interpret model performance.

## **Expected Deliverables**
- **Key Insights**: Identification of app attributes most strongly associated with high user ratings.  
- **Predictive Model**: A trained model capable of estimating app ratings based on given features.  
- **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for app developers and marketers to enhance user satisfaction and app quality.
