# **HCDE 410 Final Project: Google Play Store Apps Rating Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the factors influencing user ratings of Google Play Store applications and developing a predictive model for app ratings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this study seeks to identify key attributes that drive user satisfaction and provide actionable insights to improve app design and marketing strategies.

---

## **Objectives**
1. Analyze the relationship between various app attributes (e.g., category, size, price) and user ratings.
2. Build and evaluate a predictive model for estimating app ratings.
3. Offer data-driven recommendations to app developers and marketers for optimizing user experience and engagement.

## **Data Source**
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on Google Play Store apps, including attributes such as:
- App category
- User ratings
- Number of reviews
- Size
- Installs
- Type (free/paid)
- Price
- Content rating

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and normalize data for better model performance.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and interpret the distribution of app attributes and their relationship with user ratings.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that improve the predictive power of the model.  
4. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate machine learning models, including regression and classification approaches.  
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), accuracy, and feature importance to interpret model performance.

## **Expected Deliverables**
- **Key Insights**: Identification of app attributes most strongly associated with high user ratings.  
- **Predictive Model**: A trained model capable of estimating app ratings based on given features.  
- **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for app developers and marketers to enhance user satisfaction and app quality.
